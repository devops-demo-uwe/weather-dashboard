Create .github/copilot-instructions.md for ASP.NET Core weather dashboard with current weather, 5-day forecast, city search, favorites, responsive design. Include project overview and core features only.

Add technical requirements section to the copilot-instructions.md: .NET Core 9 with Razor Pages (no MVC), Azure Table Storage with local emulator for development, OpenWeatherMap API integration, Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI.

Add security guidelines section: Use .NET Secret Manager for development, prepare for Azure Key Vault in production, implement input validation, secure API key handling, and follow secure coding practices throughout.

Add coding standards section: Use async/await patterns, nullable reference types enabled, proper error handling with try-catch blocks, implement logging, follow C# naming conventions, add XML documentation for public APIs, use dependency injection throughout. Keep existing content and format for consistency.

Reorganize the sections in logical order, keep the formatting consistent, but do not omit any existing content.

Create minimal project structure with basic startup configuration only. No weather features yet - just a running app with placeholder homepage.
